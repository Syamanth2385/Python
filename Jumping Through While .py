# Given a positive integer x, the task is to print the numbers from 1 to x in the order as 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, ... (in increasing order).

# Example:

# Input: x = 10
# Output: 1 4 9
# Explanation:From 1 to 10, numbers in powers of 2 are, 12, 22, 32 as 1, 4 and 9.

def printIncreasingPower(x):
    ##Your code here
    temp = 1
    # Loop to jump in powers of 2
    while(temp**2<=x):
        ##Your code here
        print ( temp**2, end = " ")
        temp+=1
